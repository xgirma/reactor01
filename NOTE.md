# Note

## 01 
1. variables initialised with `undefined`

2. `global` scope vs `function` scope

3. scope in `nested function`

4. for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... } `console.log(i) = 3` because of `var`

5. javascript interpreter hoist `function` and `variable` declarations to the top of the `current-scope`

6. declare a variable without `var`, variable attached to global scope 

7. `var` function scoped, `let` block scoped

8. reference a variable before declaration result, `var` => `undefined`, `let` => `Reference Error`

9. `const` same as `let` except once you assigned a value to a variable using `const` you can not re-assign new value for that variable.

## 10
1. You can modify the property of an object created with `const`, because it is not re-assigning, it is modifying a property.

2. You can not reassign an object created with `const`.
